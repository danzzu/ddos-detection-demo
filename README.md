# Artificial Intelligence On DDoS attack.

---

## Overview

An Artificial Intelligence, using Scikit-Learn, built to benchmark various model and detect on all types of DDoS attacks.

---
## Objective

Train multiple Artificial Intelligence models on detecting various type of DDoS attacks. Using the database, consistent of components laid out in a Excel/Spreadsheet format as an input. Return output of benchmarks for accuracy/score and time to train a model using unpredicted 20% of leftover data.
